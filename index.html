      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Originally from Norway and currently based in Berlin, I have a
        background in political science and experience as a foreign language
        teacher. Iâ€™m excited to transition into tech by starting a one-year Java
        backend development course. I love learning new things and look forward
        to applying my skills and experiences in this new field.
